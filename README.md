Set of k-mer tools used primarily for quality control. Nowhere near finished. Will also only work on my local machine.

The algorithm used in parameter_estimation.py is based off Jared Simpson's paper 'Exploring Genome Characteristics and Sequence Quality Without a Reference'. The code used in the function 'learn_mixture_parameters' is largely based off code used in his implementation of the algorithm, which can be found at https://github.com/jts/sga/blob/master/src/SGA/preqc.cpp#L429.
